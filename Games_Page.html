      <p class="chair">Hammer Time is my very first game I've made during my time at Votec. It's an extremely short 2D platformer where you control your character, named Timmothy, who has a mighty hammer that's used to destroy enemies and interact with objects. This is likely my strongest project I've worked on so far, even if at the time, I barely had any time on my hands to really refine it to perfection. It was made within the program, Construct 3, a program I had very little expirence with.</p>
